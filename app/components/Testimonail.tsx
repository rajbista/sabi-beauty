They sat there and took their time with my eyebrows, when they were done Sabi would stand over my eyebrows and basically study them to make sure they were even and make sure your eyebrows were SISTERS and not long lost cousins üòÇ BINU also did the same thing, taking her time making sure everything was even & wasn‚Äôt uncommon if someone was having an issue for BINU to step over & help them. She made sure every customer left SATISFIED and happy with the results. I‚Äôd give ANYTHING to have them come down to Tennessee."
